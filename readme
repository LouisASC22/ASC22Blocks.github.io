// Objective: Create a program where the player can move a red square with the arrow keys
// There is a bouncing blue enemy square on the canvas
// When the red square touches an "enemy" square on the canvas, the enemy square changes position 
// There is a meter at the top of the screen that counts the player's HP
// The individual tasks of this project will need to be separated for these programs to work
// I suggest moving the files around so that one draw loop file is in the folder at a time
// Make sure that the index file is in the folder with the draw loop file
// Make sure to change the name of the file that is referenced on line 10 of the index file
// If the draw loop file is not named "sketch.js", change it from "sketch.js" to the name of the file that is being used to draw
// The program will not work unless the index file references the correct draw loop file
// If no changes are made to any of the other three folders in this zip, the programs will work
